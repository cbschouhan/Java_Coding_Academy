Git hub notes

We will be using GIThub , GITbucket, GIT Lab


# Create new repository. Public is free and private is paid. Readme file is the first file that everybody reads put descition 
# INstall GIT bash
We are going to use command line because you going to be on a server and server don't have visual interface, server usages command line.
the command line is the only place you can run all Git commands — most of the GUIs implement only a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. 
# If we create any files in local directory then it will not be directly available in GIT

Command											Desciption
git --version									Get version
pwd												Unix command to get print working directory
mkdir NewDir									Create new directory
cd NewDir										change directory
ctrl+l to										clear screen
git status										gives untracked file in red

/*If latest file and folder is created in GITWeb*/
git clone https_url_from_git_web_version		clone from git web folder to local machine

/*If latest file and folder is in local machine*/
git init										to make local repository as git repository
git add file_name								untracked file_name is added in staging
git commit - m "any message"					commit the changes
git push origin master							file is pushed to gitweb
git diff file_name								shows the new changes
git checkout #value								to get previous version
git checkout master								to get latest version

if you need a private repository then guthub has paid service, use gitlab.com it is completely free service.
